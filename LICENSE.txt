During the free trial period, the GEMS Exchange APIs are strictly for personal use, and you may not share your API access or products of API usage. Please contact us if you would like to explore commercial applications.

GEMS Exchange provides APIs for your use with the intention of helping you solve some of the greatest agri-food challenges of our time. It goes without saying (but we’re saying it anyway) that we strongly discourage you from using our APIs to engage in any unlawful or malicious behavior. We want to ensure that everyone in our community – developers, data scientists and other professionals – honors the high standards of integrity, performance, and privacy that guide our work at GEMS Informatics and the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) and Research Computing (including both the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and U-Spatial) at the University of Minnesota.

We value data privacy, and so should you. Our privacy policy states, in clear terms, how sensitively any information collected from our users is handled, used and stored. We hope whatever you create using our APIs has the same set of priorities. In short, please don’t abuse our APIs. We have shared them with you to make the web and the world a better place. Help us do that by following these guidelines and our terms of use.
